# INF1771 - Artificial Intelligence

**2014.1**

Projects for the Artificial Intelligence course at PUC-Rio.


## Project 1

We solved a heuristic search problem, finding the shortest path from the starting point to the goal, going through three different checkpoints in any order (kind of like the travelling salesman problem).


## Project 2

Pending.
